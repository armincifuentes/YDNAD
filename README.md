*A.K.A. "You dont need a designer"*

So, you wanna build the next killer social app. Got the perfect pitch, mad dev skills, but no designer to give your vision a *look and feel* up to standards.

Don't worry. You don't need a designer. Just like [@shesho](http://twitter.com/shesho) [wrote about a year ago](https://uxmag.com/articles/why-web-design-is-dead), there are so many good quality design resources available today, you can easily start building right away.

I've listed here a ton of free stuff I've found over time to help me avoid spending time designing. Just ready-to-use, so no AI, PSD files – PNG and SVG are fine. I think this his list may be handy for you if you
* can't afford a designer
* don't know how to design
* don't want to design
* don't at all.

Dive right in fellow developer, and keep in mind: any additions to this list will be mostly welcome!
